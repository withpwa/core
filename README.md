## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the [favicons](https://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons) open-source project, which laid the groundwork for this package.

Building on its foundation, this package introduces a redesigned API, additional [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/#x_localized-members) manifest support, and new features like `screenshots`, `share_target`, `file_handlers`, `protocol_handlers`, and `*_localized` fields to better support PWAs development.
